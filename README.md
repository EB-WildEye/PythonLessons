# Python Lessons Repository

Welcome to the Python Lessons Repository! This collection of Python files is designed as a friendly introduction to programming for young learners ages 10-14. Dive into the basics of Python with fun and interactive lessons!


## What's Inside?

Each Python file in this repository represents a unique lesson covering different aspects of programming, such as loops, functions, and even games. Here's a taste of what you can learn:

- `loops.py`: Learn to automate repetitive tasks with loops.
- `functions.py`: Discover how to organize code with functions.
- `classes.py`: Explore the concept of object-oriented programming.
- `mathOperations.py`: Practice arithmetic operations in Python.
- `tictactoe_final_game.py`: Apply your skills in a classic Tic Tac Toe game.

...and much more!


## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


### Installation

Replace `filename.py` with the lesson file you want to run.


## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to start with any lesson that interests you, or follow them in order if you prefer a structured approach:

Begin with dataTypesAndPrint.py to understand the basics of Python data types and printing to the console.
Move on to loops.py and functions.py to grasp control structures and modularity in coding.
Take on the passoverChallenge for a fun problem-solving activity.
Try your hand at tictactoe_final_game.py when you're ready to put your skills to the test in a game scenario.
